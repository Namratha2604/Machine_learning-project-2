# Video Game Sales Prediction

This project aims to predict video game sales based on various features such as platform, genre, publisher, and region-wise sales. The project utilizes different data preprocessing techniques and machine learning models to predict global sales.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to predict the sales of video games based on historical data and various influencing factors.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on video games such as:
- `Rank`: Rank of the video game based on sales
- `Name`: Name of the video game
- `Platform`: Platform on which the game was released (e.g., Wii, NES, GB)
- `Year`: Release year of the game
- `Genre`: Genre of the game (e.g., Sports, Platform, Racing)
- `Publisher`: The publisher of the game
- `NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, `JP_Sales`, `Other_Sales`: Sales data in different regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and others)
- `Global_Sales`: Total worldwide sales

## Installation

To set up the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-game-sales-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd video-game-sales-prediction

3.Install the required Python libraries
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusion

The project provides a thorough analysis of video game sales using various machine learning models and preprocessing techniques. Different models such as Decision Tree Regressor and Linear Regression were trained to predict global sales, and their performance was evaluated.
